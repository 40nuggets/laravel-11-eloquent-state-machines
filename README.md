## Introduction

This package allows you to simplify the transitioning of states an Eloquent model could have by
defining the transition logic in specific StateMachine classes. Each class allows you to register
validations, hooks and allowed transitions and states making each StateMachine class the only source
of truth when moving from a state to the next.

Laravel Eloquent State Machines also allow you to automatically record history of all states a model
may have and query this history to take specific actions accordingly.

At its core, this package has been created to provide a simple but powerful API so Laravel developers
feel right at home. 

**Examples**

Model with two status fields

```php
$salesOrder->status; // 'pending', 'approved', 'declined' or 'processed'

$salesOrder->fulfillment; // null, 'pending', 'completed'
```

Transitioning from one state to another
  
```php
$salesOrder->status()->transitionTo('approved');

$salesOrder->fulfillment()->transitionTo('completed');

//With custom properties
$salesOrder->status()->transitionTo('approved', [
    'comments' => 'Customer has available credit',
]);
```

Checking available transitions
  
```php
$salesOrder->status()->canBe('approved');

$salesOrder->status()->canBe('declined');
```

Checking transitions history
  
```php
$salesOrder->status()->was('approved');

$salesOrder->status()->timesWas('approved');

$salesOrder->status()->whenWas('approved');

$salesOrder->fulfillment()->snapshowWhen('completed');

$salesOrder->status()->history()->get();
```

## Usage

### Defining our StateMachine 

Imagine we have a `SalesOrder` model which has a `status` field for tracking the different stages
our sales order can be in the system: `REGISTERED`, `APPROVED`, `PROCESSED` or `DECLINED`.

We can manage and centralize all of these stages and transitions within a StateMachine class. To define
one, we can use the `php artisan make:state-machine` command.

For example, we can create a `StatusStateMachine` for our SalesOrder model

```bash
php artisan make:state-machine StatusStateMachine
```

After running the command, we will have a new StateMachine class created 
in the `App\StateMachines` directory. The class will have the following code.

```php
use Asantibanez\LaravelEloquentStateMachines\StateMachines\StateMachine;

class StatusStateMachine extends StateMachine
{
    public function recordHistory(): bool
    {
        return false;
    }

    public function transitions(): array
    {
        return [
            //
        ];
    }

    public function defaultState(): ?string
    {
        return null;
    }
}
```

Inside this class, we can define our states and allowed transitions

```php
public function transitions(): array
{
    return [
        'pending' => ['approved', 'declined'],
        'approved' => ['processed'],
    ];
}
```

We can define the default/starting state too

```php
public function defaultState(): ?string
{
    return 'pending'; // in can be null too 
}
```

The StateMachine class allows recording each one of the transitions automatically for you. To 
enable this behavior, we must set `recordHistory()` to return `true`;

```php
public function recordHistory(): bool
{
    return true; 
}
```

### Registering our StateMachine

Once we have defined our StateMachine, we can register it in our `SalesOrder` model, in a `$stateMachine`
attribute. Here, we set the bound model `field` and state machine class that will control it.  

```php
use Asantibanez\LaravelEloquentStateMachines\Traits\HasStateMachines;
use App\StateMachines\StatusStateMachine;

class SalesOrder extends Model 
{
    Use HasStateMachines;

    public $stateMachines = [
        'status' => StatusStateMachine::class
    ];   
}
```

### State Machine Methods  

When registering `$stateMachines` in our model, each state field will have it's own custom method to
interact with the state machine and transitioning methods. The `HasStateMachines` trait defines
one method per each field mapped in `$stateMachines`. Eg. 

For
```php 
'status' => StatusStateMachine::class
```

We will have an accompanying method 
```php
status()
```

with which we can use to check our current state, history and apply transitions. 

> Note: the field "status" will be kept intact and in sync with the state machine

### Transitioning States

To transition from one state to another, we can use the `transitionTo` method. Eg:

```php
$salesOrder->status()->transitionTo($to = 'approved');
```

You can also pass in `$customProperties` if needed
```php
$salesOrder->status()->transitionTo($to = 'approved', $customProperties = [
    'comments' => 'All ready to go'
]);
``` 

When applying the transition, the state machine will verify if the state transition is allowed according
to the `transitions()` states we've defined. If the transition is not allowed, a `TransitionNotAllowed`
exception will be thrown.

### Querying History

If `recordHistory()` is set to `true` in our State Machine, each state transition will be recorded in
the package `StateHistory` model using the `state_histories` table that was exported when installing the
package.

With `recordHistory()` turned on, we can query the history of states our field has transitioned to. Eg:

```php
$salesOrder->status()->was('approved'); // true or false

$salesOrder->status()->timesWas('approved'); // int 

$salesOrder->status()->whenWas('approved'); // ?Carbon
``` 

As seen above, we can check whether or not our field has transitioned to one of the queried states.

We can also get the latest snapshot or all snapshots for a given state   

```php
$salesOrder->status()->snapshotWhen('approved');

$salesOrder->status()->snapshotsWhen('approved');
```

The full history of transitioned states is also available 

```php
$salesOrder->status()->history()->get();
``` 

The `history()` method returns an Eloquent relationship that can be chained with the following
scopes to further down the results.

```php
$salesOrder->status()->history()
    ->from('pending')
    ->to('approved')
    ->withCustomProperty('comments', 'like', '%good%')
    ->get();
``` 

### Getting Custom Properties

When applying transitions with custom properties, we can get our registered values using the
`getCustomProperty($key)` method. Eg.

```php
$salesOrder->status()->getCustomProperty('comments');
```

This method will reach for the custom properties of the current state. You can get custom 
properties of previous states using the snapshotWhen($state) method.

```php
$salesOrder->status()->snapshotWhen('approved')->getCustomProperty('comments');
```

## Advanced Usage

### Adding Validations

Before transitioning to a new state, we can add validations that will allow/disallow the transition. To
do so, we can override the `validatorForTransition($from, $to, $model)` method in our state machine class.

This method must return a `Validator` that will be used to check the transition before applying it. If
the validator `fails()`, a `ValidationException` is thrown. Eg:

```php
class StatusStateMachine extends StateMachine
{
    public function validatorForTransition($from, $to, $model): ?Validator
    {
        if ($from === 'pending' && $to === 'approved') {
            return ValidatorFacade::make([
                'total' => $model->total,
            ], [
                'total' => 'gt:0',
            ]);
        }
        
        return parent:validatorForTransition($from, $to, $model);
    }
}
```

In the example above, we are validating that our Sales Order model total is greater than 0 before
applying the transition. 

### Adding Hooks 

We can also add custom hooks/callbacks that will be executed once a transition is applied. 
To do so, we must override the `transitionHooks()` method in our state machine.

The `transitionHooks()` method must return an keyed array with the state and the callback/closure
to be executed. Eg. 

```php
class StatusStateMachine extends StateMachine
{
    public function transitionHooks(): array
    {
        return [
            'processed' => function ($from, $model) {
                // Add any further processing, eg
                // Dispatch jobs, events, send mails, etc.
            },
        ];
    } 
}
```
